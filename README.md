2) The the EN-RU translation task by different ways:

   some used approachs:
      using RNNs as encoder and decoder with attention mechanism  
      CNN encoder (with or without positional encoding)   
      pretraining the language model  
      using transformers  
      
3) enhance one the models in previous item using Self-critical Sequence Training   
    look at https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00563
